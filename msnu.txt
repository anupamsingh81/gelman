"To start with, given sufficiently diffuse prior distribution(implying all effects whether large or small are equally likely), the posterior distribution would be approximately normal with mean " +m+" standard error "+ s+ " , which would imply about an "+  norm1.toFixed(3) + " probability that the true effect is positive. In general, the more concentrated the prior distribution around 0 (i.e., a presumption based on the historical data/literature  that the true effect is likely to be small), the closer the posterior probability will be to 50%.For example, consider a Cauchy distribution with center 0 and scale "+ A+ ", which implies that the effect, is most likely to be near zero, with a 50% chance of being in the range [−"+A+","+A+"], a 90% chanceof being in the range [−"+3.3*A+","+3.3*A+"], and a 94% chance of being less than "+10*A+ " . We center the prior distribution at zero because, ahead of time, we have no particular reason to believe the coefficient will be positive or negative. The Cauchy family has flat tails so that, if the data doconvincingly show a very large effect, this will not be contradicted by the prior distribution.We combine the prior distribution with the normal likelihood for the regression coefficient on the standardized effect coefficient (that is, the likelihood corresponding to the normal distribution with mean "+m+" and standard deviation "+s+"). The resulting posterior distribution gives a probability that the effect is positive is "+integra.toFixed(3)+ " and even if the effect is positive, there is a "+integrum.toFixed(3)+" chance it is less than specified threshold of "+t+ "."
